## Practice Apigee

### Create your Apigee account: https://login.apigee.com/sign_up
It's now or never:heavy_exclamation_mark:

### Create your API specification
![alt text](./images/OpenAPI.JPG)

By using [Apigee](https://apigee.com/specs) or [Swagger](http://editor.swagger.io/#/)

:muscle: It's time to exercise...

### Create an API proxy from SOAP service

SOAP service for testing: http://www.webservicex.com/New/Home/ServiceDetail/56
The WSDL: http://www.webservicex.com/globalweather.asmx?wsdl

:muscle: It's time to exercise...

### Create an API proxy from specification

The [Arkadin specifications](https://app.swaggerhub.com/search?query=%20arkadin)

The [JSON specification for the Subsidiaries API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apiproxy/schema/file/arkadin_api/Subsidiaries/1.0.0/swagger.json)

:muscle: It's time to exercise...

### Create an REST API proxy 

Use the Rest API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

:muscle: It's time to exercise...

#### Add a quota limit
#### Create a specific endpoint (for the URL /users)
#### Add a JSON-To-XML policy
##### Add a condition on policy

:muscle: It's time to exercise...

#### Add a apikey verification
In order to use the apikey, explain the publish process (developers, app, product and key).

Please, show me the [video](https://vimeo.com/113342105) (and listen the beautiful music :hear_no_evil:)

## Arkadin feedbacks

![alt text](./images/IloveAPI.JPG)

1. Customers API (production)
2. Subsidiaries API (production)
3. Events API (prototype at the moment, production on September)

### Specification
OpenAPI and Swagger, Apigee isn't enought strong (or not enought finish, as you prefer).

### Mock
Used and approved by Arkadin :thumbsup:

### Development
Easy to use
Easy to understand
Easy to version
You have to know policies and how retrieve the documentation about parameters (because there's a lot of parameters)
I have to draw up a best practices document for my succesors :blue_book:

### Test
##### Postman, Postman and Postman :thumbsup:
##### Collection runner on Postman 
Postman collection runner to automatize tests
But how test the API availability in production:question:

### Production
Several environments :thumbsup:, easy to configure. Load balancing.

#### Reports
To explore in details
